# Learning-Genie

Description: This program plays 20 Questions with the user, learning from its mistakes and building a database of questions and guesses. It was written in Java using the Eclipse IDE, interfaces, binary search trees, and recursion.

The user thinks of a thing and the application asks a series of questions until it feels like it make a guess. However, unlike a human that chooses their questions with care, this applications “learns” from all the games it has played in order to ask questions. At the end of each game, if the application makes an incorrect guess, it asks the user for a discriminating question that distinguishes between the application’s guess and the user’s intended object. The application then stores this and uses this question in future iterations of the game.
