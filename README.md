# Learning-Genie

Description: This program plays the game Twenty Questions with the user, learning from its mistakes and building a database of questions and guesses. It was written in Java using the Eclipse IDE, Java interfaces, binary search trees, and recursion.

The user thinks of an object and the application asks a series of questions until it feels like it can make a guess. However, unlike a human that chooses their questions with care, this applications “learns” from all the games it has played, developing a knowledge database. At the end of each game, if the application makes an incorrect guess, it asks the user for a discriminating question that distinguishes between the application’s guess and the user’s intended object. The application is then able to use this knowledge in future iterations of the game.
